- Rewards are distributed proportionally to share ownership
- Users can claim pending rewards at any time

- Maximum supply cap protection

## Usage

### For Vault Owners

```javascript
// Deploy vault
const vault = await VaultToken.deploy("My Vault", "MVT", underlyingTokenAddress);

// Distribute rewards
await vault.distributeRewards(ethers.parseEther("1000"));
```

### For Users

```javascript
// Deposit tokens
await underlyingToken.approve(vault.address, amount);
await vault.deposit(amount);

// Check rewards
const pending = await vault.pendingRewards(userAddress);

// Claim rewards
await vault.claimRewards();

// Withdraw (after lock period)
await vault.withdraw(shares);
```
