## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Cross-Chain Deployment

```bash
# Using Hardhat tasks
npx hardhat crosschain:deploy \
  --networks "ethereum,polygon,arbitrum" \
  --contracts "./deployment-config.json" \
  --verify

# Using CLI
npx payrox-crosschain deploy \
  --networks "ethereum,polygon,arbitrum" \
  --contracts "./deployment-config.json" \
  --verify
```

### Salt Generation

```bash
# Generate universal salt
npx hardhat crosschain:generate-salt \
  --content "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b50..." \
  --deployer "0x742d35Cc6641C2dCeF174097D589e3C6f1a4e5C0" \
  --version "1.0.0" \
  --nonce "1"
```

### Address Prediction

```bash
# Predict addresses across networks
npx hardhat crosschain:predict-addresses \
  --networks "ethereum,polygon,arbitrum" \
  --salt "0x1234567890abcdef..." \
  --bytecode "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b50..."
```

### Network Health Check

```bash
# Check network health
npx hardhat crosschain:health-check \
  --networks "ethereum,polygon,arbitrum"
```

## 📋 Configuration Format

### Contracts Configuration (`crosschain-contracts.json`)

```json
{
  "contracts": [
    {
      "name": "ExampleContract",
      "bytecode": "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b50...",
      "constructorArgs": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "gasLimit": 2000000,
      "priority": 1
    }
  ],
  "deployment": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "deployer": "0x742d35Cc6641C2dCeF174097D589e3C6f1a4e5C0",
    "nonce": 1
  }
}
```

### Network Configuration Integration

```typescript
// Enhanced NetworkConfig in src/utils/network.ts
export interface NetworkConfig {
  chainId: number;
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  rpcUrl: string;
  explorerUrl: string;
  isTestnet: boolean;
  factoryAddress?: string; // New: DeterministicChunkFactory
  dispatcherAddress?: string; // New: ManifestDispatcher
  deploymentPath: string;

describe('Cross-Chain Deployment', () => {
  it('should deploy consistently across networks', async () => {
    const orchestrator = new CrossChainOrchestrator(networkConfigs);
    const deployment = await orchestrator.deployAcrossChains(
      ['hardhat', 'localhost'],
      contracts,
      privateKey
    );

    expect(deployment.status).to.equal('SUCCESS');
    // Additional consistency checks...
  });
