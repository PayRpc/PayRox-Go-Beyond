## üìã Core Methods

### `checkFacetStorageCompatibility(facets: ParsedContract[])`

Performs comprehensive storage analysis across multiple facets:

- Analyzes storage slot usage patterns
- Detects conflicts and collision risks
- Generates security recommendations
- Provides gas optimization suggestions

### `generateDiamondSafeLayout(facets: ParsedContract[])`

Creates production-ready diamond storage implementation:

- Generates storage structs with proper namespacing
- Creates slot assignments using keccak256 hashing
- Produces complete Solidity implementation
- Generates PayRox manifest metadata

### `validatePayRoxCompatibility(facets, isolationReport)`

Validates storage for PayRox ecosystem integration:

- Checks facet isolation requirements
- Validates namespace uniqueness
- Ensures security specifications
- Verifies upgrade mechanism presence

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Storage Analysis Process

1. **Phase 1: Data Collection** - Gather storage metadata from all facets
2. **Phase 2: Conflict Detection** - Identify slot collisions and overlaps
3. **Phase 3: Security Analysis** - Scan for vulnerabilities and risks
4. **Phase 4: Optimization Analysis** - Find gas savings opportunities
5. **Phase 5: Recommendation Generation** - Provide actionable fixes
6. **Phase 6: Isolation Assessment** - Score facet independence

### Diamond Storage Pattern Validation

- **Struct type verification** - Ensures proper storage structure
- **Slot assignment validation** - Prevents slot 0 usage and conflicts
- **Namespace format checking** - Validates naming conventions
- **Access pattern analysis** - Ensures proper storage access

## üìä Report Structure

### StorageLayoutReport

```typescript
interface StorageLayoutReport {
  totalSlots: number;
  usedSlots: number;
  conflicts: StorageConflict[];
  diamondPatterns: DiamondStoragePattern[];
  facetStorageMetadata: Record<string, FacetStorageMetadata>;
  facetIsolation: FacetIsolationReport;
  diagnostics: {
    securityIssues: string[];
    gasOptimizations: string[];
    recommendations: string[];
  };
  compatibility: PayRoxCompatibilityReport;
}
```

### Conflict Analysis

- **Severity classification** - Critical, high, medium, low risk levels
- **Variable mapping** - Shows exact conflicts between facets
- **Recommendation engine** - Provides specific fixes for each conflict
- **Impact assessment** - Evaluates business and technical risk

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Storage Security Scanning

- **Admin privilege protection** - Detects vulnerable admin storage
- **Reentrancy risk analysis** - Identifies storage-based reentrancy
- **Upgrade safety validation** - Ensures safe storage migrations
- **Access control verification** - Validates storage access patterns

### Risk Level Assessment

- **Critical**: Multiple conflicts or admin vulnerabilities
- **High**: Overlapping facets with storage conflicts
- **Medium**: Minor conflicts with isolation issues
- **Low**: Fully isolated storage with no conflicts

## üéØ Gas Optimization Features

### Slot Packing Analysis

- **Automatic detection** of packing opportunities
- **Waste calculation** showing unused bytes per slot
- **Reorganization suggestions** for optimal packing
- **Cost-benefit analysis** of storage modifications

### Constant Optimization

- **Immutable candidate detection** - Variables that can be constants
- **Storage vs memory analysis** - Optimal data location suggestions
- **Access pattern optimization** - Efficient storage layouts

## üìà Integration with PayRox Ecosystem

### Manifest Generation

- **Automatic metadata creation** for PayRox manifests
- **Version tracking** with namespace versioning
- **Deployment coordination** with other PayRox tools
- **Upgrade path planning** for storage migrations

### Compatibility Validation

- **Isolation score calculation** (0-100% facet independence)
- **Risk level determination** based on conflicts and patterns
- **Issue categorization** with actionable recommendations
- **Manifest readiness assessment** for deployment approval

## üîÑ Development Workflow Integration

### AI Assistant Integration

- **Automated analysis** during contract development
- **Real-time feedback** on storage design decisions
- **Recommendation engine** for best practices
- **Pattern library** for common storage layouts

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
