# PayRox Tasks Connection Summary

## âœ… What We've Created

All PayRox Hardhat tasks are now seamlessly connected through npm scripts for improved developer
workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ New npm Scripts Available

### Manifest Operations

```bash
npm run payrox:manifest:check --path=manifests/example.json
npm run payrox:manifest:verify --path=manifests/example.json  # Includes facet verification
```

### Chunk Operations

```bash
npm run payrox:chunk:predict --factory=0x1234... --data=0xabcd...
npm run payrox:chunk:stage --factory=0x1234... --data=0xabcd... --value=0.001
```

### Orchestration

```bash
npm run payrox:orchestrator:start --orchestrator=0x1234... --id=0xabcd... --gasLimit=500000
```

### Complete Workflow

```bash
npm run payrox:workflow:full --path=manifests/example.json
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Integration

### In `package.json`:

- Added 6 new PayRox-specific npm scripts
- Maintained consistency with existing naming conventions
- Created workflow script that chains operations

### In `docs/PAYROX_TASKS_GUIDE.md`:

- Comprehensive documentation for all PayRox tasks
- Usage examples and parameter reference
- Integration benefits and troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations and best practices

## ðŸš€ Benefits Achieved

### Developer Experience

- **Shorter Commands**: `npm run payrox:manifest:check` vs `npx hardhat payrox:manifest:selfcheck`
- **Better Discoverability**: All PayRox tasks visible in `npm run`
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows existing npm script conventions
- **IDE Integration**: Better VS Code task runner support

### Workflow Automation

- **Chained Operations**: Workflow scripts combine multiple tasks
- **Error Propagation**: Failed tasks halt workflow execution
- **Status Reporting**: Clear success/failure indicators
- **Log Integration**: Consistent logging across all tasks
