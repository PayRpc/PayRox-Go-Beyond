# CI Acceptance Tests

This directory contains acceptance tests that should be run in CI to ensure production readiness and comprehensive test coverage.

## Test Files

### 1. `facet-size-cap.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Verify all facets respect EIP-170 runtime size limits (≤ 24,576 bytes)

**What it tests**:
- ExampleFacetA runtime bytecode size
- ExampleFacetB runtime bytecode size
- Fails build if any facet exceeds limit

**Run with**:
```bash
npx hardhat test test/facet-size-cap.spec.ts
```

### 2. `orchestrator-integration.spec.ts` 
**Purpose**: Unit test that Orchestrator properly integrates with IChunkFactory

**What it tests**:
- `orchestrateStage()` calls `IChunkFactory.stage()` and emits `ChunksStaged`
- `orchestrateStageBatch()` calls `IChunkFactory.stageBatch()` and emits `ChunksStaged`
- Component noting emits `ComponentNoted` events
- Orchestration lifecycle emits `OrchestrationStarted` and `OrchestrationCompleted`

**Run with**:
```bash
npx hardhat test test/orchestrator-integration.spec.ts
```

### 3. `coverage-boost.spec.ts` ⭐ **NEW**

**Purpose**: Comprehensive coverage enhancement targeting specific uncovered lines across all contracts

**What it tests**:

- **ExampleFacetB edge cases**: Complex validation scenarios, batch processing limits, toggle state management
- **DeterministicChunkFactory advanced features**: Fee sweeping, batch operations, edge case handling
- **ManifestUtils comprehensive coverage**: Input validation, error handling, edge cases
- **TestOrderedMerkle complete verification**: All proof validation scenarios and edge cases
- **System integration patterns**: Cross-contract interactions and state management

**Coverage Achievement**:

- **Overall**: 89.66% → 93.79% (+4.13 percentage points)
- **ExampleFacetB**: 83.33% → 96.67% (+13.34 points)
- **DeterministicChunkFactory**: 87.5% → 93.75% (+6.25 points)
- **TestOrderedMerkle**: 75% → 100% (+25 points)

**Run with**:

```bash
npx hardhat test test/coverage-boost.spec.ts
```

### 4. `route-proof-selfcheck.ts`

**Purpose**: Verify manifest Merkle proofs against computed leaves

**What it does**:

- Loads current manifest from `manifests/current.manifest.json`
- Recomputes leaves using `keccak256(abi.encode(selector, facet, codehash))`
- Rebuilds Merkle tree with ordered-pair hashing (no sorting)
- Verifies each proof against the manifest root
- Ensures OpenZeppelin MerkleProof compatibility

**Run with**:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/route-proof-selfcheck.ts
```

```

### Route Proof Self-Check

```text
🔍 Starting Route Proof Self-Check...
📋 Loaded manifest with 5 routes
🌳 Building Merkle tree from computed leaves...
📊 Computed root: 0x1234...
📊 Manifest root: 0x1234...
✅ Merkle root matches computed value
✅ Valid proof for selector 0x12345678
✅ Valid proof for selector 0x23456789
...
🎯 All route proofs verified successfully!
✅ Route Proof Self-Check completed
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Facet size exceeds EIP-170 limit"

- Review facet implementation for optimization opportunities
- Consider splitting large facets into smaller components
- Use assembly optimizations where appropriate

### "Invalid proof for selector"

- Check manifest generation process
- Verify ordered-pair hashing implementation
- Ensure no sorting during Merkle tree construction

### "No routes found in manifest"

- Verify manifest file exists at `manifests/current.manifest.json`
- Check manifest generation scripts
- Ensure proper manifest structure
