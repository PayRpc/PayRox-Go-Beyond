## Test Files

### 1. `facet-size-cap.spec.ts`

**Purpose**: Verify all facets respect EIP-170 runtime size limits (‚â§ 24,576 bytes)

**What it tests**:

- ExampleFacetB runtime bytecode size
- Fails build if any facet exceeds limit

**Run with**:

```bash
npx hardhat test test/facet-size-cap.spec.ts
```

### 2. `orchestrator-integration.spec.ts`

**Purpose**: Unit test that Orchestrator properly integrates with IChunkFactory

**What it tests**:

- `orchestrateStage()` calls `IChunkFactory.stage()` and emits `ChunksStaged`
- `orchestrateStageBatch()` calls `IChunkFactory.stageBatch()` and emits `ChunksStaged`
- Component noting emits `ComponentNoted` events
- Orchestration lifecycle emits `OrchestrationStarted` and `OrchestrationCompleted`

**Run with**:

```bash
npx hardhat test test/orchestrator-integration.spec.ts
```

### 3. `coverage-boost.spec.ts` ‚≠ê **NEW**

**Purpose**: Comprehensive coverage enhancement targeting specific uncovered lines across all
contracts

**What it tests**:

- **ExampleFacetB edge cases**: Complex validation scenarios, batch processing limits, toggle state
  management
- **DeterministicChunkFactory advanced features**: Fee sweeping, batch operations, edge case
  handling
- **ManifestUtils comprehensive coverage**: Input validation, error handling, edge cases

```

### 4. `route-proof-selfcheck.ts`

**Purpose**: Verify manifest Merkle proofs against computed leaves

**What it does**:

- Loads current manifest from `manifests/current.manifest.json`
- Recomputes leaves using `keccak256(abi.encode(selector, facet, codehash))`
- Rebuilds Merkle tree with ordered-pair hashing (no sorting)
- Verifies each proof against the manifest root
- Ensures OpenZeppelin MerkleProof compatibility

**Run with**:

```

### 5. **PayRox Production Utilities** ‚≠ê **NEW**

**Purpose**: Production-grade manifest validation, chunk prediction, and staging utilities

#### 5.1 Manifest Self-Check Task

**Purpose**: Validates manifest integrity and cryptographic consistency

**What it does**:

- Loads and validates manifest structure (supports both `root` and `merkleRoot` fields)
- Verifies route proofs against Merkle root (when proof data available)
- Computes manifest hash for integrity verification (when header present)
- Handles multiple manifest formats gracefully

**Run with**:

```bash
npx hardhat payrox:manifest:selfcheck --path manifests/current.manifest.json
npx hardhat payrox:manifest:selfcheck --path manifests/smoke-test.manifest.json
```

**Expected Output**:

- Ensures exact same creation code/salt policy as contract
- Supports both hex data and file input

**Run with**:

```bash
npx hardhat payrox:chunk:predict --factory 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512 --data 0x1234567890abcdef
npx hardhat payrox:chunk:predict --factory 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512 --file path/to/bytecode.hex
```

**Note**: Requires deployed DeterministicChunkFactory with `predict(bytes)` method

#### 5.3 Chunk Staging

**Purpose**: Stages chunk data on-chain with size validation and gas estimation

**What it does**:

- Validates chunk data size and format
- Executes staging transaction through DeterministicChunkFactory
- Returns transaction hash and confirmation
- Provides gas usage feedback

**Run with**:

```bash
npx hardhat payrox:chunk:stage --factory 0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512 --data 0x1234567890abcdef
```

**Expected Output**:

```text
‚õìÔ∏è  stage(tx): 0xbba2874704d502f03c4adf8054c615537e78c78628cad160072e45311a10c855
‚úÖ mined in block 1

üìã Loaded manifest with 5 routes
üå≥ Building Merkle tree from computed leaves...
üìä Computed root: 0x1234...
üìä Manifest root: 0x1234...
‚úÖ Merkle root matches computed value
‚úÖ Valid proof for selector 0x12345678
‚úÖ Valid proof for selector 0x23456789
...
üéØ All route proofs verified successfully!
‚úÖ Route Proof Self-Check completed
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Facet size exceeds EIP-170 limit"

- Review facet implementation for optimization opportunities
- Consider splitting large facets into smaller components
- Use assembly optimizations where appropriate

### "Invalid proof for selector"

- Check manifest generation process
- Verify ordered-pair hashing implementation
- Ensure no sorting during Merkle tree construction

### "No routes found in manifest"

- Verify manifest file exists at `manifests/current.manifest.json`
- Check manifest generation scripts
- Ensure proper manifest structure

### PayRox Utilities Troubleshooting

#### "Manifest missing merkleRoot/root or routes"

- Ensure manifest file has either `root` or `merkleRoot` field
- Verify `routes` array exists and has at least one entry
- Check manifest file format and JSON validity

#### "could not decode result data" (chunk prediction)

- Verify DeterministicChunkFactory is deployed at the specified address
- Ensure contract has `predict(bytes)` method
- Check network connection and provider configuration
- Try redeploying the factory contract

#### "No route proofs found in manifest for verification"

- This is informational - manifest lacks embedded proof data
- Generate manifest with proof data for full verification
- Use manifests with `proof` and `positions` fields for complete validation

#### "route.proof and route.positions are required for verification"

- Manifest format doesn't include proof data in routes
- Update manifest generation to include Merkle proofs
- Use `payrox:manifest:selfcheck` for basic validation without proofs
