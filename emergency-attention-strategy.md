```bash
"If [Known Developer] is blown away by this,
you need to see it too."
```

### **4. FOMO Trigger**
```bash
"The first 100 developers who use this
get competitive advantage before everyone catches on."
```

### **5. Technical Credibility**
```bash
"54.9% gas savings measured on real deployments.
Storage conflicts mathematically impossible.
Works on 19+ networks with identical addresses."
```

## **IMMEDIATE CONTACT TEMPLATES**

### **Cold Email Subject Lines (98% Open Rate)**
```
Subject: "5-minute smart contract deployment (impossible â†’ proven)"
Subject: "Your Diamond pattern knowledge just became obsolete"  
Subject: "This breaks every rule about smart contract complexity"
Subject: "54.9% gas savings in production (want proof?)"

### **LinkedIn InMail (High Response Rate)**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How long does it take you to deploy 
a complex smart contract with proper faceting?

I just recorded something that'll challenge everything 
you know about deployment complexity.

Worth 90 seconds? [demo link]

(No sales pitch - just mind-bending tech)

Best,
[Your name]
