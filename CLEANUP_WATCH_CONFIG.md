# Configuration Cleanup: watch.json Removed

## Summary
Removed the unused `config/watch.json` file and updated references to use the active monitoring configuration approach.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Files
- `config/watch.json` - Orphaned monitoring configuration with no implementation

### ✅ Updated References
- `scripts/comprehensive-test-runner.ts` (3 locations):
  - Changed from checking `config/watch.json` to `config/monitoring.json`
  - Updated comments to reflect current monitoring approach

## Rationale

The `watch.json` file contained comprehensive monitoring configuration but:
- No code actually consumed its values (`monitoredSelectors`, `criticalSelectors`, etc.)
- The `payrox:ops:watch` task exists but uses command-line parameters instead
- Current monitoring uses `monitoring.json` generated by `next-steps.ts`
- File was only referenced for existence checks, not actual configuration

## Impact
- ✅ No functional impact - no features broken
- ✅ Cleaner configuration structure
- ✅ Reduced confusion about which monitoring config is active
- ✅ Test runner now checks for the correct monitoring configuration file

## Current Monitoring Approach
The system now properly references `config/monitoring.json` which is:
- Generated by the next-steps automation
- Used by the actual monitoring features
- Consistent with the implemented monitoring system

---
**Status**: ✅ Cleanup Complete - Unused configuration removed
