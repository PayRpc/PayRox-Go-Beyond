## 🎯 DEMO SCRIPT (Keep this open while recording)

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
**SAY THIS:**
> "Everyone said you need weeks to learn Diamond patterns to deploy complex smart contracts. 
> 
> Watch me deploy a 150KB DeFi protocol in 5 minutes with ZERO Diamond knowledge required.
> 
> This should be impossible... but here we go."

**DO THIS:**
- Start recording
- Show the challenge clearly
- Build anticipation

### Show The Complexity (60 seconds)
**SAY THIS:**
> "This is what we're deploying - a 150KB enterprise DeFi protocol.
> 
> It has 50+ functions: lending, borrowing, staking, governance, insurance.
> 
> Traditionally, this would take 3 weeks to learn Diamond patterns, 
> 2 weeks to implement, and probably another week debugging storage conflicts."

**DO THIS:**
- Open `contracts/demo/ComplexDeFiProtocol.sol`
- Scroll through the functions slowly
- Emphasize the complexity

### The Magic Moment (3 minutes)
**SAY THIS:**
> "But watch this magic... One command. That's it."

**DO THIS:**
- Run: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File demo-viral-clean.ps1`
- Let the script run
- Narrate each step as it happens

**NARRATE WHILE SCRIPT RUNS:**
> "It's analyzing the contract structure...
> 
> Generating optimized facets automatically...
> 
> Look at that - perfect isolation, gas optimization, emergency controls...
> 
> Total time: 4 seconds for a 150KB contract!"

### The Mind-Blow Finish (90 seconds)
**SAY THIS:**
> "But here's the kicker - this deployed with IDENTICAL addresses on 19+ networks.
> 
> Same contract on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism - same address everywhere.
> 
> And we can do hot upgrades with zero downtime.
> 
> This breaks every rule about smart contract complexity.
> 
> The future of blockchain development just arrived."
