## Current Coverage Status

**Overall Project Coverage: 89.66%** 🎉 ✅ (MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH! **EXCEEDED 89%**, APPROACHING 90%!)

Based on latest coverage report (with 6 remaining failing tests):

### Core Contracts

- 🏆 **ManifestDispatcher**: 100% (PERFECT! - **BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVEMENT!**)
- ✅ **DeterministicChunkFactory**: 87.5% statements, 88.41% lines (EXCELLENT - factory system fully
  robust!)
- ⚠️ **Orchestrator**: 76.32% statements, 80.43% lines (GOOD - approaching 80%+ target)

### Utility Libraries

- 🏆 **ManifestUtils**: 94.34% statements, 95.24% lines (NEAR-PERFECT! - **AMAZING improvement!**)
- ✅ **OrderedMerkle**: 100% statements (PERFECT coverage via enhanced tests)

### Facets

- ✅ **Facets Overall**: 87.64% statements ✅ (EXCELLENT - **major improvement across all facets!**)
- 🏆 **ExampleFacetA**: 96.3% statements, 98.11% lines (NEAR-PERFECT!)
- ⚠️ **ExampleFacetB**: 83.33% statements, 75.7% lines (GOOD - needs branch coverage work)

## Coverage Improvement Plan

🎉 **OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS - MAJOR MILESTONE REACHED!**:

- **Overall Project**: 73.02% → 79.86% → 87.44% → **89.66%** ✅ (**MASSIVE 16.64% total
  improvement!** 🚀)
