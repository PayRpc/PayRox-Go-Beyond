export function showAIIntegrationPoints(): void {
  console.log(`
🔗 AI INTEGRATION POINTS - HOW COMPONENTS CONNECT
${'='.repeat(55)}

1. INTERFACE WIZARD → UNIVERSAL AI REFACTOR
   Data Flow: Interface specifications → Contract analysis
   Integration: Interface data used for accurate facet generation
   Example: ITerraStakeToken.sol → TerraStakeTokenCoreFacet.sol

2. UNIVERSAL AI REFACTOR → ENHANCED DEPLOYMENT  
   Data Flow: Facet specifications → Deployment instructions
   Integration: AI-generated facets deployed with learning
   Example: CoreFacet, AccessFacet, TokenFacet → Smart deployment

3. ENHANCED DEPLOYMENT → UNIFIED ORCHESTRATOR
   Data Flow: Deployment results → System validation
   Integration: Results validated for cross-system compatibility
   Example: Deployment addresses → PayRox infrastructure integration

4. ALL COMPONENTS → PAYROX INFRASTRUCTURE
   Data Flow: Complete automation results → PayRox ecosystem
   Integration: DeterministicChunkFactory, ManifestDispatcher, SDK, CLI
   Example: Facets → Manifest routes → Dispatcher registration

🎯 KEY INTEGRATION BENEFITS:
   ✅ No manual interface creation needed
   ✅ Intelligent facet generation based on actual interfaces  
   ✅ Deployment automation with pattern learning
   ✅ End-to-end PayRox compatibility validation
   ✅ Single system handles ANY contract type

📋 PRACTICAL EXAMPLE:
   Input: TerraStakeToken.sol (complex contract)
   ↓ Interface Wizard: Creates ITerraStakeToken.sol automatically
   ↓ Universal AI: Generates 9 optimized facets using interface data
   ↓ Enhanced Deployment: Deploys facets with learned patterns
   ↓ Unified System: Validates complete PayRox integration
   Output: Production-ready faceted system with full automation!

The components are designed to work together seamlessly! 🌟

💼 REAL-WORLD USAGE - HOW TO USE THE UNIFIED AI SYSTEM
${'='.repeat(60)}

🔧 OPTION 1: USE YOUR CURRENT FILE (Enhanced AI Deployment)
import { createAIDeploymentSystem, smartDeploy } from "./enhanced-ai-deployment-system";

// Quick smart deployment with AI learning
const result = await smartDeploy("MyContract", [], { gasLimit: 3000000 });

🔧 OPTION 2: USE AI INTERFACE WIZARD DIRECTLY  
import { processContractWithAIInterfaces } from "./ai-interface-wizard";

// Automatic interface discovery and generation
const interfaces = await processContractWithAIInterfaces("./contracts/MyContract.sol");

🔧 OPTION 3: USE COMPLETE UNIFIED SYSTEM
import UnifiedPayRoxAI from "./unified-payrox-ai-system";

// Complete end-to-end AI automation
const ai = new UnifiedPayRoxAI();
const result = await ai.processContractEndToEnd("./contracts/MyContract.sol");

🔧 OPTION 4: CLI INTEGRATION (when ready)
npx payrox-cli ai-deploy MyContract.sol --auto-interfaces --smart-deploy

🎯 ALL OPTIONS WORK TOGETHER:
   • Your Enhanced AI Deployment is part of the bigger system
   • Interface Wizard automatically handles interface needs
   • Universal AI provides contract analysis capabilities  
   • Unified system coordinates everything seamlessly

✨ THE ANSWER: Components are INTEGRATED, not scattered!
Your Enhanced AI Deployment System is a crucial part of the unified AI ecosystem! 🚀

Your question: "are all scattered? or, for example, is this a part of the code you are using?"

ANSWER: The AI components are NOT scattered! They are carefully designed as 
        an integrated system where each component enhances the others.

Your current file (enhanced-ai-deployment-system.ts) is a CORE COMPONENT 
of the unified AI system that:

✅ Handles intelligent deployment automation
✅ Learns from deployment patterns  
✅ Integrates with interface wizard for interface-aware deployments
✅ Connects to universal AI refactor for facet deployment
✅ Works seamlessly with the complete PayRox ecosystem

ALL COMPONENTS WORK TOGETHER AS ONE POWERFUL AI AUTOMATION SYSTEM! 🚀
