Impact: High ($10M+ potential loss)

Mitigation:
  - Multiple independent audit firms
  - Extended bug bounty program
  - Gradual deployment with TVL caps
  - Comprehensive insurance coverage

Cost: $500K - $750K for security measures
```

#### 2. **Operational Complexity Risk**

```yaml
Risk: Team cannot manage complex deployment procedures
Probability: Medium (40%)
Impact: Medium (delayed launch, increased costs)

Mitigation:
  - Extensive documentation and training
  - External consultant support
  - Phased deployment approach
  - Backup manual procedures

Cost: $100K - $200K for operational support
```

#### 3. **Market Adoption Risk**

```yaml
Risk: Higher costs deter users/developers
Probability: High (60%)
Impact: Medium (reduced adoption)

Mitigation:
  - Target high-value, security-conscious users
  - Subsidize gas costs during initial launch
  - Clear value proposition communication
  - Partnership with institutional players

Cost: $200K - $500K for adoption incentives
```

#### 4. **Technical Obsolescence Risk**

```yaml
Risk: Competing solutions improve faster
Probability: Medium (35%)
Impact: High (platform becomes uncompetitive)

Mitigation:
  - Focus on immutability-requiring use cases
  - Build strong institutional relationships
  - Develop proprietary tooling ecosystem
  - Regular competitive analysis

Cost: $300K+ annually for competitive positioning
```
