## PayRox Go Beyond Competitive Position

### Technical Advantages

#### 1. **Cryptographic Security**

```solidity
// PayRox: Every call verified against manifest
function _verifyRoute(bytes4 selector) internal view {
    Route memory route = routes[selector];
    require(route.facet.codehash == route.codehash, "CodehashMismatch");
}
```

**Advantage**: Runtime code verification prevents code substitution attacks

#### 2. **Deterministic Deployment**

```typescript
// Predictable addresses across networks
const salt = keccak256(concat(['chunk:', keccak256(bytecode)]));
const predictedAddress = getCreate2Address(factory, salt, bytecode);
```

**Advantage**: Reproducible deployments for cross-chain consistency

#### 3. **Non-Upgradeable by Design**

```solidity
// No upgrade functions - immutable once deployed
contract ManifestDispatcher {
    bool public frozen; // One-way freeze only
    // No diamondCut, no proxy upgrades
}
```

**Advantage**: Eliminates entire class of upgrade-related vulnerabilities

### Technical Limitations

#### 1. **Deployment Complexity**

- **Route Application**: ~200K gas per route vs. 21K for Diamond
- **Merkle Proof Size**: 32 bytes × log₂(routes) per call
- **Multi-Transaction Setup**: Requires commit→apply→activate flow

#### 2. **Scalability Constraints**

```
Real-world limits (validated through testing):
- Maximum Facets: 256 (across multiple factories)
- Routes per Block: ~150 (gas limited)
- Deployment Time: ~27 minutes for full 16,384 routes
```

#### 3. **Operational Overhead**

- **Manifest Management**: Complex JSON structures
- **Merkle Tree Computation**: Requires specialized tooling
- **Multi-Factory Coordination**: Higher DevOps complexity
