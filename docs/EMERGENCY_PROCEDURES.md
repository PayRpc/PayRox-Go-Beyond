# Emergency Response Procedures - PayRox Go Beyond

This document outlines the emergency response procedures for the PayRox Go Beyond system, including detection, containment, investigation, and recovery protocols.

## üö® Emergency Response Overview

The PayRox Go Beyond system includes multiple layers of emergency controls designed to rapidly contain and resolve security incidents while maintaining system integrity.

### Emergency Response Team

**Primary Contacts:**
- **Incident Commander**: Lead security engineer
- **Technical Lead**: Smart contract architect  
- **Communications Lead**: Community relations manager
- **Business Lead**: Product owner

**Emergency Escalation:**
1. **Level 1**: Automated detection and immediate containment
2. **Level 2**: Human review and targeted response
3. **Level 3**: Full emergency protocol with external communication
4. **Level 4**: System-wide shutdown and incident investigation

## üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Emergency Controls

### 1. Forbidden Selectors (Immediate Protection)

**Purpose**: Instantly disable malicious or compromised function selectors

```solidity
// Emergency protection mechanism
function addForbiddenSelector(bytes4 selector) external onlyRole(EMERGENCY_ROLE) {
    forbiddenSelectors[selector] = true;
    emit SelectorForbidden(selector, msg.sender, block.timestamp);
}
```

**Activation Time**: < 30 seconds  
**Scope**: Individual function selectors  
**Reversible**: Yes, through new manifest epoch

### 2. Emergency Pause (System-Wide Protection)

**Purpose**: Immediately halt all system operations

```solidity
// System-wide emergency pause
function pause() external onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE) {
    _pause();
    emit EmergencyPause(msg.sender, block.timestamp);
}
```

**Activation Time**: < 60 seconds  
**Scope**: Entire system  
**Reversible**: Yes, through unpause mechanism

### 3. Route Removal (Targeted Containment)

**Purpose**: Remove specific compromised routes while maintaining system operation

```solidity
// Remove compromised routes
function removeRoutes(bytes4[] calldata selectors) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < selectors.length; i++) {
        delete routes[selectors[i]];
        emit RouteRemoved(selectors[i], msg.sender);
    }
}
```

**Activation Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Scope**: Specific function routes  
**Reversible**: Yes, through manifest update

### 4. Manifest Rollback (System Recovery)

**Purpose**: Deploy safe version of the system with known-good configuration

**Activation Time**: 5-15 minutes  
**Scope**: Complete system state  
**Reversible**: Yes, through new manifest deployment

## üîç Detection and Alerting

### Automated Monitoring

**On-Chain Monitors:**
- Unusual gas consumption patterns
- Failed transaction rate anomalies
- Unauthorized role assignments
- Suspicious function call patterns
- Large token transfers or approvals

**Off-Chain Monitors:**
- Contract bytecode verification failures
- Social engineering attempts on team members
- Phishing domains targeting users
- Unusual network traffic patterns

### Alert Thresholds

| Severity | Threshold | Response Time | Actions |
|----------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Exploit in progress | < 5 minutes | Immediate pause + investigation |
| **High** | Potential vulnerability | < 30 minutes | Targeted protection + analysis |
| **Medium** | Anomalous activity | < 2 hours | Enhanced monitoring + review |
| **Low** | Unusual patterns | < 24 hours | Standard investigation |

## üöÄ Emergency Response Procedures

### Procedure 1: Suspected Exploit Detection

**Immediate Response (0-5 minutes):**
1. **Activate Emergency Pause**
   ```bash
   npm run emergency:pause
   ```

2. **Notify Emergency Team**
   - Incident Commander
   - Technical Lead
   - Security team

3. **Document Initial Findings**
   - Transaction hashes
   - Affected contracts
   - Estimated impact

**Investigation Phase (5-30 minutes):**
1. **Analyze Transaction Patterns**
   ```bash
   npm run emergency:analyze -- --tx-hash 0x...
   ```

2. **Verify Exploit Vector**
   - Contract state analysis
   - Function call trace
   - Gas usage patterns

3. **Assess Damage Scope**
   - Affected user accounts
   - Financial impact
   - System integrity

**Containment Phase (30-60 minutes):**
1. **Implement Targeted Controls**
   ```bash
   # Forbid specific selectors if identified
   npm run emergency:forbid-selector -- 0x12345678
   
   # Remove compromised routes
   npm run emergency:remove-routes -- --facet 0xFacetAddress
   ```

2. **Prepare System Recovery**
   ```bash
   npm run emergency:prepare-rollback
   ```

### Procedure 2: Compromised Facet Response

**Detection:**
- Unusual behavior from specific facet
- Failed function calls from known-good transactions
- Unexpected state changes

**Response Steps:**
1. **Immediate Containment**
   ```bash
   # Remove all routes to compromised facet
   npm run emergency:remove-facet-routes -- --facet 0xCompromisedFacet
   ```

2. **Verify Containment**
   ```bash
   npm run emergency:verify-isolation -- --facet 0xCompromisedFacet
   ```

3. **Deploy Replacement**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:facet-replacement -- --replace 0xCompromisedFacet
   ```

### Procedure 3: Emergency Manifest Rollback

**When to Use:**
- Multiple facets compromised
- Unknown attack vector
- System-wide instability

**Rollback Process:**
1. **Identify Safe Manifest Version**
   ```bash
   npm run emergency:list-manifests -- --verified-only
   ```

2. **Deploy Rollback Manifest**
   ```bash
   npm run emergency:rollback -- --manifest-version 1.2.3
   ```

3. **Verify System Integrity**
   ```bash
   npm run emergency:verify-rollback
   ```

### Procedure 4: Communication Protocol

**Internal Communications (Immediate):**
- Emergency team Slack channel
- SMS/call tree activation
- Stakeholder notifications

**External Communications (Coordinated):**
- User notifications (in-app, email)
- Social media updates
- Status page updates
- Exchange notifications (if applicable)

**Communication Templates:**
