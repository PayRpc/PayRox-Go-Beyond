# PayRox Go Beyond Threat Model

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the security threats, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies for the PayRox Go Beyond deployment framework. The system enables deterministic contract deployment and dynamic function routing, introducing unique security considerations that require careful analysis.

## System Architecture

### Trust Boundaries

1. **Admin Layer**: Core system administrators with deployment privileges
2. **Orchestrator Layer**: Automated deployment and upgrade management  
3. **Contract Layer**: Smart contract execution and state management
4. **User Layer**: External users interacting with deployed contracts

### Key Components

- **DeterministicChunkFactory**: Deploys contracts with predictable addresses
- **ManifestDispatcher**: Routes function calls based on manifest configuration
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates complex deployment processes
- **Manifest System**: Manages deployment configuration and verification

## Threat Analysis

### T1: Unauthorized Deployment

**Description**: Attacker deploys malicious contracts through the factory

**Impact**: High - Could compromise entire system integrity

**Attack Vectors**:
- Compromised admin private keys
- Social engineering against authorized deployers
- Exploitation of factory authorization logic

**Mitigations**:
- Multi-signature requirements for deployments
- Hardware security modules for key storage
- Time-locked deployment for critical changes
- Audit trail for all deployment activities

**Implementation**:
```solidity
modifier onlyAuthorizedDeployer() {
    require(authorizedDeployers[msg.sender], "Unauthorized");
    require(deploymentTimelock[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp, "Timelocked");
    _;
}
```

### T2: Manifest Manipulation

**Description**: Attacker modifies manifest to redirect function calls

**Impact**: Critical - Could hijack all contract functionality

**Attack Vectors**:
- Direct manifest tampering
- Signature forgery attempts
- Merkle tree manipulation
- Replay attacks with old manifests

**Mitigations**:
- Cryptographic manifest signing with ECDSA
- Merkle tree verification for chunk integrity
- Nonce-based replay protection
- Manifest version validation

**Implementation**:
```solidity
function verifyManifest(ReleaseManifest memory manifest) internal view {
    bytes32 hash = calculateManifestHash(manifest);
    require(verifySignature(hash, manifest.signature, authorizedSigner), "Invalid signature");
    require(manifest.header.timestamp > lastManifestTimestamp, "Outdated manifest");
    require(verifyMerkleRoot(manifest.chunks, manifest.merkleRoot), "Invalid merkle root");
}
```

### T3: Function Selector Collision

**Description**: Malicious facet registers selectors conflicting with system functions

**Impact**: Medium - Could break routing or enable unauthorized access

**Attack Vectors**:
- Intentional selector collision with critical functions
- Hash collision attacks on function signatures
- Selector squatting for future function conflicts

**Mitigations**:
- Whitelist of reserved selectors
- Collision detection during manifest validation
- Secure hash functions for selector generation
- Regular audit of registered selectors

**Implementation**:
```solidity
mapping(bytes4 => bool) private reservedSelectors;

function validateSelectors(bytes4[] memory selectors) internal view {
    for (uint i = 0; i < selectors.length; i++) {
        require(!reservedSelectors[selectors[i]], "Reserved selector");
        require(!manifest[selectors[i]].isActive, "Selector already registered");
    }
}
```

### T4: Gas Limit Exploitation

**Description**: Attacker exhausts gas limits to cause denial of service

**Impact**: Medium - Could make system unusable

**Attack Vectors**:
- Setting excessive gas limits in manifests
- Gas griefing attacks in batch operations
- Recursive calls consuming available gas

**Mitigations**:
- Maximum gas limit validation
- Gas measurement and monitoring
- Circuit breakers for excessive consumption
- Rate limiting for batch operations

**Implementation**:
```solidity
modifier gasLimitCheck(uint256 gasLimit) {
    require(gasLimit <= MAX_GAS_LIMIT, "Gas limit too high");
    require(gasLimit >= MIN_GAS_LIMIT, "Gas limit too low");
    _;
}
```

### T5: CREATE2 Address Manipulation

**Description**: Attacker manipulates salt values to deploy contracts at specific addresses

**Impact**: High - Could enable contract impersonation

**Attack Vectors**:
- Salt grinding to achieve desired addresses
- Front-running deployment transactions
- Address collision with existing contracts

**Mitigations**:
- Deterministic salt generation from manifest data
- Address reservation system
- Deployment order validation
- Pre-deployment address verification

**Implementation**:
```solidity
function generateSalt(string memory name, bytes32 manifestHash) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(abi.encodePacked("PayRox", name, manifestHash, block.timestamp));
}
```

### T6: Upgrade Path Exploitation

**Description**: Attacker exploits upgrade mechanism to inject malicious code

**Impact**: Critical - Could completely compromise system

**Attack Vectors**:
- Malicious upgrade proposals
- Bypassing upgrade validation
- Race conditions in upgrade process
- Storage layout corruption

**Mitigations**:
- Multi-step upgrade validation process
- Storage layout compatibility checks
- Upgrade simulation on testnets
- Emergency pause mechanisms

**Implementation**:
```solidity
function proposeUpgrade(ReleaseManifest memory newManifest) external onlyAuthorized {
    require(validateUpgradeCompatibility(currentManifest, newManifest), "Incompatible upgrade");
    
    upgrades[upgradeCounter] = UpgradeProposal({
        manifest: newManifest,
        proposer: msg.sender,
        timestamp: block.timestamp,
        executed: false
    });
    
    emit UpgradeProposed(upgradeCounter, msg.sender);
    upgradeCounter++;
}
```

## Security Controls

### Access Control Matrix

| Role | Factory Deploy | Manifest Update | Emergency Pause | Upgrade Approval |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Admin | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Deployer | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Operator | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |
| User | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

### Cryptographic Controls

- **Manifest Signing**: ECDSA with secp256k1 curve
- **Merkle Trees**: SHA256 for chunk verification
